# TODO App Lessons

Welcome to the **TODO App Lessons** repository! ðŸŽ¯  
This repository is designed to guide students through the process of building a fully functional TODO application using **JavaScript, DOM manipulation, local storage, and API requests**.

Each lesson is structured to ensure **hands-on coding**, requiring students to complete tasks before moving on to the next lesson.

Each lesson has:
- A dedicated markdown file (e.g., `LESSON01.md`, `LESSON02.md`).
- Starter files in the `lesson-files/` directory.
- Core coding exercises.
- Optional bonus challenges for advanced learners.
